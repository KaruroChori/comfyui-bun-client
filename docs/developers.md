## Test suite

To run the test suite, a compatible ComfyUI instance is needed.  
Its address can either be set in the environment file `.env.test` as `COMFY`, or it will default to `localhost:8188`.

## Examples

Examples of usage of this library can be found in `./examples`.

## Linting

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/linter/) is used as linter. A configuration file is provided in the root directory, and your editor is expected to run it _on save_.  
At the very least, make sure to run it before a commit to master or PR is done.
