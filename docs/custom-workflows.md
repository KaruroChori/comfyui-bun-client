Custom workflow are now implemented and tested to be minimally working. Bugs are somewhat expected.  
You can check `examples/custom-workflow` to see how they can be implemented.

Unlike in that example you are probably not interested in generating the new `interface.ts` file over and over, so it is just put there as reference.  
In a realistic scenario that would be only done once by a script in your `package.json`.
