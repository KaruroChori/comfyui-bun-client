Custom workflow are now implemented and have been tested to be working.  
However, this feature is quite fresh, not the normal test-suite does not cover it yet. So bugs and regressions in future releases are still possible.
As a quick start, you can check the example in `examples/custom-workflow` to see how they can be implemented in your application.

Unlike that example, generating the `interface.ts` file at each run is not a good idea, and you would probably do it only once as part of a script in the `package.json` of your project.

## Building the `interface.ts` file

## Defining the DAG

### Terminal values

## Compiling
